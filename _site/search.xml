      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I participated in the competition <a href="https://almundo.com.ar/eci/contest">AlMundo Challenge</a>
organized by <a href="https://almundo.com.ar/">almundo.com</a> in the context of <a href="https://www.dc.uba.ar/events/eci/2017">ECI2017</a>.</p>

<p>I found the problem interesting, and although the model I worked with was in 4th place <a href="https://almundo.com.ar/eci/ranking">(ranking)</a>, I would like to share it as an example of an integer programming application.</p>

<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>

<p>The complete description of the problem is <a href="https://almundo.com.ar/eci/contest">here</a>.</p>

<p>To sum up, you have the location of 41011 cities, and a tourist who must fly to <strong>all</strong> cities, visiting each of them <strong>exactly once</strong>. In addition, in each flight he must decide which travel agency to use. There are 4 travel agencies, and each offers discounts if certain conditions are met. For example, one of the agencies grants a 35% discount in case of flying with it for 3 consecutive times.</p>

<p>The objective of the problem is to decide <em>in which order</em> cities should be visited and <em>which agency to use</em> in each flight, seeking to minimize the total cost, taking into account that all agencies have the same rate: $0.01 per Km.</p>

<p>A part of this problem (<em>in which order</em>) is related to another very famous problem: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">The traveling salesman problem</a>, which is very studied and for which there is <a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/index.html">much literature</a>.</p>

<h1 id="my-approach">My approach</h1>

<p>One of my favorite tools for tackling optimization problems is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming"><strong>integer programming</strong></a>. To be simple, the idea is to construct a mathematical model that describes the conditions imposed by the problem and the objective function to be minimized. As its name implies, it is important that the relationships between the model variables are <strong>linear</strong>.</p>

<p>I decided to split the original problem into two parts: 1) get an initial tour without taking into account the agencies, and therefore without discounts (the tour should visit all cities exactly once and be as cheap as possible); 2) look for <strong>the best</strong> possible way of assigning agencies to a given route.</p>

<p>Note that this is a <em>heuristic</em> since the optimal solution to the original problem is not necessarily obtained by assigning agencies to the shortest route, and often using a higher-cost route could induce greater discounts (given the conditions of the agencies), and consequently a lower total cost.</p>

<h2 id="stage-i-the-tour">Stage I: the tour</h2>

<p>To get an initial tour (leaving aside the agencies), first I thought about using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde_TSP_Solver">Concorde</a>. This program allows you to get the optimal route as long as the number of cities is <em>reasonable</em>. I could not make Concorde work for 41011 cities, so I tried with the well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin%E2%80%93Kernighan_heuristic">Lin-Kernighan heuristic</a>, and in particular the implementation that is <a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde/downloads/downloads.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>The best route I got at this stage was <strong>7754930.68</strong> km.</p>

<h2 id="stage-ii-assigment">Stage II: assigment</h2>
<h3 id="model">Model</h3>

<p>If we consider the route of the previous stage and assign to all trips agency type D, we have a total cost of <strong>$65924.31</strong> that serves as a baseline.</p>

<p>Now we want to get the <strong>best</strong> way to allocate agencies. For this purpose, I constructed a model with the variables <script type="math/tex">X_ {a, e}</script> where <script type="math/tex">a \in \{A, B, C, D \}</script> and <script type="math/tex">e</script> is an edge of the tour (the trip between two cities).</p>

<p>If we define:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
X_{a,e} = \begin{cases} 1 & \mbox{si } a\mbox{ is assigned to edge } e \\ 0 & \mbox{other case} \end{cases} %]]></script>

<p>it is possible to model the constraint <code class="highlighter-rouge">every edge must have an agency assigned</code> as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">X_{A,e} + X_{B,e} + X_{C,e} + X_{D,e} = 1</script>

<p>for each edge <script type="math/tex">e</script> in the route.</p>

<p>It is also necessary to model the cost function that we want to minimize. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Agency B applies a discount of 15% provided that the assigned edge is more than 200km long</code>. Taking this into account, we can model the discount of agency B as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum_{e\in T} X_{B,e} * w_e * 0.15 * (w_e > 200) * 0.01</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">T</script> is the tour, and <script type="math/tex">w_e</script> is the distance in kilometers of the edge <script type="math/tex">e \in T</script>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <code class="highlighter-rouge">agency C applies a discount of 20% provided that the previous trip is assigned to agency B</code>. To model this discount, one possibility is to incorporate the following variables:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
Y_{e_i,e_{i+1}} = \begin{cases} 1 & \mbox{si } X_{B,e_i} = 1 \wedge X_{C,e_{i+1}} = 1 \\ 0 & \mbox{other case} \end{cases} %]]></script>

<p>for each pair of consecutive edges <script type="math/tex">(e_i, e_{i + 1})</script> in the tour.</p>

<p>The motivation of this variable is to be able to know when there is an assigned agency B before agency C, and thus to be able to apply the corresponding discount. The discount of agency C is then modeled as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum_{1\leq i \leq 41010} Y_{e_i,e_{i+1}} * w_{e_{i+1}} * 0.20 * 0.01</script>

<p>In addition, it is necessary to linearly establish the relationship between the variables <script type="math/tex">Y_{e_i,e_{i+1}}</script>, <script type="math/tex">X_{B,e_i}</script> and <script type="math/tex">X_{C,e_{i+1}}</script> to meet the definition above:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Y_{e_i,e_{i+1}} \leq X_{B,e_i}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Y_{e_i,e_{i+1}} \leq X_{C,e_{i+1}}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Y_{e_i,e_{i+1}} + 1 \geq X_{B,e_i} + X_{C,e_{i+1}}</script>

<p>for each <script type="math/tex">i</script> such that <script type="math/tex">1 \leq i \leq 41010</script>.</p>

<p>To model the frequent flyer discount, where <code class="highlighter-rouge">agency A applies a 35% discount every time the agency is used for the third consecutive time</code>, we use a similar idea. We add the variable:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
Y_{e_i,e_{i+1},_{i+2}} = \begin{cases} 1 & \mbox{si } X_{A,e_i} = 1 \wedge X_{A,e_{i+1}} = 1 \wedge X_{A,e_{i+2}} = 1 \\ 0 & \mbox{other case} \end{cases} %]]></script>

<p>for each <script type="math/tex">i</script> such that <script type="math/tex">1 \leq i \leq 41009</script>.</p>

<p>The motivation is to know that there are 3 consecutive assignments of agency A and that it is worth applying the discount. The detail in this case is that if you have for example, 8 consecutive times agency A, the discount applies only in the cost of the third and sixth time, as clarified in the <a href="https://almundo.com.ar/eci/faq">FAQ</a>. For this reason, we also add the following constraint:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Y_{e_i,e_{i+1},e_{i+2}} + Y_{e_{i+1},e_{i+2},e_{i+3}} + Y_{e_{i+2},e_{i+3},e_{i+4}} \leq 1</script>

<p>for each <script type="math/tex">i</script> such that <script type="math/tex">1 \leq i \leq 41007</script>.</p>

<p>And also an adapted version of the previous restrictions:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Y_{e_i,e_{i+1},e_{i+2}} \leq X_{A,e_i}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Y_{e_i,e_{i+1},e_{i+2}} \leq X_{A,e_{i+1}}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Y_{e_i,e_{i+1},e_{i+2}} \leq X_{A,e_{i+2}}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Y_{e_{i-2},e_{i-1},e_i} + Y_{e_{i-1},e_i,e_{i+1}} + Y_{e_i,e_{i+1},e_{i+2}} + 2 \geq X_{A,e_i} + X_{A,e_{i+1}} + X_{A,e_{i+2}}</script>

<p>with the corresponding adjustment in the first 2 trips of the tour, where <script type="math/tex">Y_{e_{i-2},e_{i-1},e_i}</script> and/or <script type="math/tex">Y_{e_{i-1},e_i,e_{i+1}}</script> must not be added.</p>

<p>We can then model the discount as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum_{1\leq i \leq 41009} Y_{e_i,e_{i+1},e_{i+2}} * w_{e_{i+2}} * 0.35 * 0.01</script>

<p>The last detail is about the discount of accumulating kilometers, where <code class="highlighter-rouge">agency D returns a fixed amount of $15 per 10000km traveled with this agency</code>. We define <script type="math/tex">Y_D \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}</script> as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Y_D = \left\lfloor \frac{1}{10000} * \sum_{e \in T} X_{D,e} * w_e \right\rfloor</script>

<p>as the amount of times we discount $15. To linearize <script type="math/tex">Y_D</script> we add the following constraints:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{10000} * \sum_{e \in T} X_{D,e} * w_e \leq Y_D + (1-\epsilon)</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Y_D \leq \frac{1}{10000} * \sum_{e \in T} X_{D,e} * w_e</script>

<p>and we model the discount simply as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Y_D * 15</script>

<p>Interestingly, since the objective function seeks to maximize the discount, the first restriction on <script type="math/tex">Y_D</script> will not be necessary and the optimal solution will be such that the restriction is met.</p>

<p>Finally, the objective function to be maximized is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">discount =</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum_{e\in T} X_{B,e} * w_e * 0.15 * (w_e > 200) * 0.01</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">+ \sum_{1\leq i \leq 41010} Y_{e_i,e_{i+1}} * w_{e_{i+1}} * 0.20 * 0.01</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">+ \sum_{1\leq i \leq 41009} Y_{e_i,e_{i+1},e_{i+2}} * w_{e_{i+2}} * 0.35 * 0.01</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">+ Y_D * 15</script>

<p>or equivalently, we want to minimize:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum_{e\in T} w_e * 0.01 - discount</script>

<h3 id="solving-the-model">Solving the model</h3>

<p>To solve the model there are many alternatives, each with different advantages and disadvantages. During the competition I considered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PuLP">PuLP</a>, a Python library that allows you to code the model and call general-purpose solvers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPLEX">CPLEX</a>, one of the best (if not the best) general purpose solvers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I used PuLP to quickly code the model and CPLEX to solve it.</p>

<p>The optimal assignment over the aforementioned tour has a cost of <strong>$63828.5</strong> (that is, we improved the solution by $2095.81).</p>

<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>

<p>I got my best final solution by incorporating a little local search on the previous solution trying to improve it. I managed to get down to <strong>$63815.82</strong> only by swapping the order of consecutive cities.</p>

<p>An interesting observation is that it is possible to model the original (<strong>complete</strong>) problem using integer programming. With only a few hours left to finish the competition, a friend who was playing (<em>fedepousa</em>) share me the model he had built since he was going on vacation and could not spend more time in the competition. This model was exact for the complete problem, but it is unthinkable to run it on the whole instance. I took his model and incorporated it as a local search operator, applying it in <em>chunks</em> of my best route. It is an expensive operator in terms of time, and applying it in sub-routes of 20 cities, every 20 cities, took a little less than 2 hours. Although the <strong>optimum</strong> in each chunk is being solved, there is a risk of deteriorating the total solution since the operator has no overall visibility of the route. A final combination of this operator, the simple swaps, and the optimal allocation that I presented before, was the one that left me in fourth place with a tour of <strong>$63801.03</strong>. Thanks <em>fedepousa</em>!</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to mention that the time that I could use during the few days of the competition was limited, and surely there are infinite improvements on the proposed model. I also think it would be valuable to experiment with more local search operators (and in particular with the exact model for the whole problem).</p>
